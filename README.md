# Weboops
Welcome to my new site Weboops 👋

Personal project which aims to train me to create a commercial site with Nuxt2, TailwindCSS, Sanity, Stripe technologies. At first it should have been in Nuxt 3 and Strapi but for hosting concerns I downgraded the version. The payment links are in test form; you will not be charged upon purchase (but check anyway). The form is not functional.

Access: [weboops.netlify.app](https://weboops.netlify.app)
## Installation

```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/zozo404/Weboops.git

$ cd Weboops

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# If that doesn't work, check if the node version is = 16.20
$ nvm list
$ nvm use 16.20

```
🔌 Data is stored on Sanity

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
